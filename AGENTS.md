# Agent Guidelines

## Scope
These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Coding conventions
- Preserve existing file formats and indentation. For `sources.json`, keep entries formatted with two-space indentation and `ensure_ascii` disabled so non-ASCII characters stay readable.
- Avoid reordering keys unless necessary for the change being made.

## Testing
Run the unit tests with:

```
pytest
```

Ensure the test suite succeeds before finalizing changes.
